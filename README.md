### Real time object detection using YOLO V3 architecture

You Only Look Once (YOLO) which first came on the computer vision scene with the seminal 2015 paper by Joseph Redmon et al [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) is one of the most effective object detection algorithms in computer vision domain since it is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system.
